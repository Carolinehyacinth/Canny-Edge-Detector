Step 4 Bug fix in non_max_supp function
For omitted pixels in the picture, I fix the two conditions
 of terminating the loops from "nrows-2" and "ncols-2" to "nrows-1" and "ncols-1". And after the bug fix, the pictures have a few differences which are 123 different pixels.

Step 5 Clean-up the source code so that there are no compilation warnings
There are three kinds of warnings in this code.

The first kind of warnings is about unused variables, such as "pos", "c" and "r" in the function "canny", and "sumpix", "cc", "rr", "i" and "lowcount" in the function "apply_hysteresis". To solve these warnings, I delete the initialization statements of the unused variables.

The second kind of warnings is about the return of the functions "non_max_supp" and "follow_edge". In the original code, these two functions have not set the types of the two return. So according to the original code, I set the types as "void".

The third kind of warnings is about the return of the main function. Because of the specificity of the main function, I must set the return of the main function as "int" and add one statement "exit(0);" at the end of the code.

After my changes, there are no warning showed.
