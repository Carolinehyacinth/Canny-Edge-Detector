# Embedded System Modeling-- Canny Edge Detector algorithm
•	The project is to use a system-level description language System C to design a suitable embedded system model of the Canny Edge Detector algorithm.

•	Technical work: Convert the application of Canny Edge Detector to process a stream of video frames and add a test bench and platform structure to the clean SLDL model for simulation.  According to the effects of the functions, refine the model with structural hierarchy in the DUT and the Gaussian Smooth block. To improve the operating efficiency, slice two blocks BlurX and BlurY into parallel components.
